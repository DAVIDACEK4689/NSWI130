## Level 1: System Context Diagram

The Exams Manager System provides functionality to manage exam terms, registrations, and results. It interacts
with three main user roles:

- **Teachers** - create and manage exam terms and assign grades/credits.
- **Students** - register for exams and view results.
- **Statisticians** - analyze exam trends and performance metrics.

The system integrates with an external SIS system to synchronize and fetch additional data.
